        <p>If you need permissions to send tweets, please message /u/Lieselta on Reddit or on Discord via the AustraliaSim ABC Discord, available <a href="https://discord.gg/QtDZgQk">here.</a> Or, if you are a journalist or member of the Moderation Team and wish to have administrator permissions, contact Lieselta via the aforementioned methods too.</p>
